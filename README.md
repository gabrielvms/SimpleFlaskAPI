# SimpleFlaskAPI
This project should be a simple api writed in python that will use google's firebase as it's database
the goal here is to be possible to do all the CRUD operations and implement the swagger to "document" it

For this project you will need to have one google cloud account and one firebase "database"
then in the api.py file you should rename the "Simpleflaskapi_serviceAcc_Key.json" file path to your
service account key file from the firebase database
